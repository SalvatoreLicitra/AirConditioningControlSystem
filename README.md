# AirConditioningControlSystem
An air-conditioning control system (simulated by a RGB led) using Cayenne and Arduino Uno. ​

A digital temperature and humidity sensor sends the data to the microcontroller that writes them on an LCD screen and sends them to Cayenne. Using the Cayenne Dashboard we can manage the information and we can decide to switch on either the heating system (Red led), the dehumidifier (Green led) or the cooling system (Blue led).​
